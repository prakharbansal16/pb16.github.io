                            Cosmology as a field has reached an interesting stage in history, where the quality of data and our analysis methods are becoming better and better day by day. Each new survey helps us answer some of the previously unknow things about the Universe (or atleast that's what we expect). Unfortunately,
                            things have not been that straightforward in the brief history of Cosmology. Starting with the Hubble Tension, which has been around for atleast 10 years now, is the issue of the current expansion rate (parametrised by Hubble constant $H_0$)
                            having different values when measured through two independent techniques. As both techniques are got better in a decade, the errorbars on both the measurement values kept getting shorter and shorter. So much so that the
                            value of $H_0$ from the two techniques are now $\sim$ 7 $\sigma$ apart.

                                The latest addition to this list of "Crises in Cosmology" has been the
                                growing evidence for time-varying dark energy. The current best model of
                                Dark Energy (the mysterious component of the Universe which is repsonsible for its accelerating expansion) goes by the name $\Lambda$CDM. 
                                In this model the energy density of the dark energy component ($\Lambda$) remains constant in time. So far this model has worked remarkably well and has been
                                able to successfully explain most of our observations in the past two decades.
                                But the latest set of data releases in 2024 and 2025 from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration, have shown some hints of departure from this $\Lambda$CDM model and indeed show some evidence in favour of a time-varying Dark Energy, when combined with external data,
                                If confirmed, this would one of the biggest discoveries in Cosmology, since the discovery of Dark Energy in 1998.
                                This has sparked a lot of interest in the community, with a lot of discussion around what could cause this departure from $\Lambda$CDM.
